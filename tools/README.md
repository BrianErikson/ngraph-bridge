## Introducing grappler and tf2ngraph

### Normal mode of operations
The normal mode of operation of `ngrph_bridge` is:
```
import ngraph_bridge

in0, in1, out0 = construct_network()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(out0, feed_dict = {in0:[2,3], in1:[4,5]})
```

The "normal" mode latches onto `Tensorflow` operations by registering `GraphOptimizationPass`es such as `NGraphRewritePass` and `NGraphVariableCapturePass`. It also register a custom op `NGraphEncapsulate`. Note that the graph rewriting and the actual execution all happens when `session.run` is called


### Introducing `Grappler`
`Grappler` can be thought of as a function that accepts a `graphdef` and returns a (most likely) new modified `graphdef`, although in cases of failure to transform, `Tensorflow` will silently continue to run with the input untransformed `graphdef`. Recently we have added a way to build `ngraph-bridge` with `Grappler`, by using the `--use_grappler_optimizer` flag in `build_ngtf.py`. We register the `NgraphOptimizer` as our `Grappler` pass. It pretty much does the same rewriting that `NGraphRewritePass` and `NGraphVariableCapturePass` was doing earlier, except for some subtle differences. For example, when `grappler` receives the graph in a certain stage of the `Tensorflow` execution pipeline which is different from when the `GraphOptimizationPass`es worked. Also we add `IdentityN` nodes to outputs to ensure we also capture output nodes, because by default `grappler` leaves out the `fetch`/output nodes.

A sample script will look like:
```
import ngraph_bridge

in0, in1, out0 = construct_network()
sess = tf.Session(config=ngraph_bridge.update_config(tf.ConfigProto()))
result = sess.run(out0, feed_dict = {in0:[2,3], in1:[4,5]})
```

Notice the new line introduced here wrt the "normal" path. `config_updated = ngraph_bridge.update_config(config)` must now be passed during session construction to ensure `NgraphOptimizer` `grappler` pass is enabled. Like the "normal" path, in this script too the graph rewriting and actual execution happen when `session.run` is called.


### tf2ngraph

The advantage of `grappler` is that the graph rewriting can happen before `session.run` is called. This is exactly what `tf2ngraph` does. The workflow can now look like this:
```
python tf2ngraph.py --inputpbtxt input.pbtxt --outnodes out_node --outputpbtxt output.pbtxt --ngbackend CPU
```
followed by
```
import ngraph_bridge
from google.protobuf import text_format

with open('output.pbtxt', "r") as f:
    text_format.Merge(f.read(), graph_def)
sess = tf.Session(graph=graph)
in0 = get_tensor_by_name('in0')
in1 = get_tensor_by_name('in1')
out0 = get_tensor_by_name('out0')
result = sess.run(out1, feed_dict={in0:[2,3], in1:[4,5]})
```

Note that in the second phase, we did not need `ngraph_bridge.update_config`. This is because all graph rewrites have finished in the first phase (`tf2ngraph`) and now in the second phase the `import ngraph_bridge` is needed only to identify the custom op `NGraphEncapsulate`, but not for rewrites. If we set the environment flag `NGRAPH_TF_LOG_PLACEMENT=1` in the first phase, we would see the TF nodes with some being placed on `ngraph`. If we use `NGRAPH_TF_LOG_PLACEMENT=1` in the second phase, we would not see most `tensorflow` nodes since they have disappeared inside `NGraphEncapsulate`s. We will only see a few `tensorflow` nodes (those unsupported by `ngraph-bridge` hence not captured inside `NGraphEncapsulate`) and some `NGraphEncapsulate` nodes. All nodes will be shown placed on `HOST` and not on `ngraph` (because `NGraphEncapsulate` runs on `HOST`)

Some features of `tf2ngraph:
1. You can get a comprehensive help string using: `python tf2ngraph.py -h`
2. It supports 3 input formats: `pb`, `pbtxt` and `saved model`
3. It supports 3 output formats: `pb`, `pbtxt` and `saved model`
4. It requires the user to specify the output node names using `--outnodes`. For example: `--outnodes add:0,sub:0`
5. Optionally one can also specify the backend along with config strings after colons `--ngbackend NNPI` or `--ngbackend GPU:0` etc. By default we use CPU
6. Its pytest/unit test is present [here]
7. `tf2ngraph` can be used in 2 ways: CLI and python functional api. The CLI is well tested and recommended for now

## build_utils, test_utils
These files contain some useful functions we use for building and testing. For example:
1. **Command_executor**: The function accepts a string and executes it as a shell command
2. **Venv related functions**: `load_venv`, `install_virtual_env`, `setup_venv`
3. **Building functions**: `build_ngraph`, `build_tensorflow`, `install_tensorflow`, `build_ngraph_tf`, `install_ngraph_tf`, `install_ngraph_bridge`
4. **Git related functions**: `download_repo`, `apply_patch`
5. **Test related functions** Some test related functions in `test_utils` used for CI
